# NomGen
A burgeoning R package to generate correlated nominal data.

Find above 3 completed implementations (so far):
- CatGen2Var generates 2D categorical vectors with specificed correlation.
- 3VarNominal generated 3D categorical vectors with correlation specified between 2 pairs of variables.
- 3VarNom3Corre does the same as 3VarNominal but accepts a complete correlation structure, returning an error if it is not coherent.
